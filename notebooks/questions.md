1. How to choose open-source LLM?


2. What is the vector database?

A unique breed of databases, vector databases store data in a high-dimensional space, allowing for unique searching methods towards similarity and semantic searching (explained just below).


3. Indexing in vector store, NER, etc...

4. Embeddings. How to choose?
5. Retrieval strategies?
- Concepts:
    - BM25 Retriever
    - NLU - natural language understanding
    - MQR - Multi Query Retrieval
    - Ensemble Retriever with RRF
    - Hybrid Search
    - Recursive Retrieval and Query Engine
    - StepBack approach

6. Reranking, prompt compression, 


Evaluation:
RAG Triad of Metrics: This framework encompasses a trio of metrics, each focusing on a different aspect of the RAG system’s performance. It provides a holistic view, assessing the system’s accuracy, efficiency, and relevance.
ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation): This metric is widely used for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation, making it particularly relevant for RAG systems focused on summarization tasks.
ARES (Automatic Retrieval Evaluation System): ARES is a more recent metric, designed specifically for evaluating the performance of information retrieval components within RAG systems. It assesses how effectively the system retrieves relevant information from its database.
BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy): Traditionally used in machine translation, BLEU can be adapted to evaluate the linguistic quality and coherence of RAG-generated responses.
RAGAs (Retrieval-Augmented Generation Assessment): This is a comprehensive framework that combines aspects of retrieval accuracy and the quality of generated text, offering a nuanced evaluation of RAG systems.
