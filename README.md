# Final Project: Master Program

Welcome to the repository for my final project in the Master program. This project is dedicated to studying the management of pretrained models, specifically focusing on MLOps for pretrained models. The empirical implementation of this research is a RAG-based chatbot designed for the WiWi faculty of HU Berlin.

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for my final project in the Master program. The main focus of the project is on managing pretrained models using MLOps principles. The practical aspect of this research is demonstrated through the development of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based chatbot for the WiWi faculty of HU Berlin.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to explore and implement efficient techniques for managing pretrained models. This includes aspects such as:

- Model deployment
- Continuous integration and delivery
- Monitoring and logging
- Scaling and maintenance

The RAG-based chatbot serves as a practical example of these concepts, providing a useful tool for the WiWi faculty.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `data/`: Contains datasets used for training and evaluation.
- `models/`: Pretrained models and scripts for fine-tuning.
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts for various tasks.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and experimentation.
- `docs/`: Documentation and reports related to the project.
- `src/`: Source code for the RAG-based chatbot and other components.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the RAG-based chatbot, follow these steps:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed.
2. Run the chatbot application:

```bash
python src/chatbot.py
```

3. Interact with the chatbot via the provided interface.

For detailed usage instructions, refer to the [user guide](docs/user_guide.md).
